With the power of machine learning and python, I present to you all, a stock value prediction tool made in python.

The setup is very simple. Follow these steps to setup your own stock prediction tool!

## Setup ##
1. Install required modules by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in terminal.
2. Run main.py by running ```python main.py``` in terminal
3. Open up your webrower and visit https://127.0.0.1:5001/predict/{STOCK_TICKER} (Replace {STOCK_TICKER} with the ticker of the stock you want to predict)

**What is a "ticker"?**
A stock ticker is a unique series of letters assigned to a publicly traded company, used to identify and track its stock on exchanges. It typically consists of one to four letters. For example, "AAPL" is the stock ticker for Apple Inc., "GOOGL" for Alphabet Inc. (Google's parent company), and "TSLA" for Tesla Inc.

**How to find tickers?**
For starters, you can find tickers by visiting (Yahoo Finance)[https://finance.yahoo.com/markets/stocks/gainers/] and looking in the row that says "Symbol".
